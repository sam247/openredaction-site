# Security & Compliance

OpenRedaction is designed with privacy and security as core principles. This document outlines our security practices, data handling policies, and compliance considerations.

## Data Handling

### Stateless Processing

OpenRedaction processes text **in memory only** and does not store any data:

- **No storage**: Input text is never written to disk or databases
- **No logging**: We do not log request content or responses
- **In-memory only**: Text is processed in memory and discarded immediately after processing
- **No persistence**: No data persists beyond the request/response cycle

### Data Flow

When you use the hosted API:

1. **Request received**: Your text is received via HTTPS
2. **In-memory processing**: Text is processed entirely in memory
3. **Response sent**: Only the detection results are returned
4. **Data discarded**: All input text is immediately discarded

When you use the npm library:

- **Local processing**: All processing happens on your infrastructure
- **No network calls**: By default, no data leaves your environment
- **AI assist (optional)**: Only when explicitly enabled, text is sent to our hosted AI proxy

### Data Retention

**Zero retention policy**: We do not retain any user data.

- No data is stored after processing
- No backups or archives of request content
- No analytics or monitoring of request content
- No data sharing with third parties

## Privacy

### GDPR / UK-GDPR Compliance

OpenRedaction follows data minimization principles:

- **Minimal data collection**: We only process the text you provide
- **No personal data storage**: We do not store any personal data
- **Purpose limitation**: Data is used solely for PII detection
- **Data subject rights**: Since we don't store data, there's nothing to delete or export

**Important**: While OpenRedaction helps you comply with GDPR by detecting and redacting PII, we are not a GDPR-certified service. You are responsible for ensuring your use of OpenRedaction complies with applicable regulations.

### Data Residency

**Hosted API**: Currently hosted in a single region. For strict data residency requirements, consider self-hosting.

**Self-hosting**: The npm library can be run entirely on your infrastructure, ensuring complete data residency control.

### Third-Party Services

**AI Assist**: When AI assist is enabled, text is sent to our hosted AI proxy. This proxy:
- Processes text for PII detection only
- Does not store or log input text
- Does not use data for training
- Operates under strict privacy controls

**No other third parties**: We do not share data with any other third-party services.

## Security

### Transport Security

- **HTTPS only**: All API communication uses TLS 1.2+
- **Certificate validation**: Proper SSL certificate validation
- **No plaintext**: No data is transmitted over unencrypted connections

### API Key Security

**Best Practices**:

- Store API keys securely (environment variables, secret management systems)
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments (dev, staging, production)
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

**Key Storage Recommendations**:
- Use environment variables: `process.env.OPENREDACTION_API_KEY`
- Use secret management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- Never hardcode keys in source code
- Never share keys in logs or error messages

### Input Validation

The API performs the following validation:

- **Text length**: Maximum 50,000 characters
- **Content-Type**: Must be `application/json`
- **JSON format**: Must be valid JSON
- **Character encoding**: UTF-8 supported

Invalid inputs are rejected with appropriate error codes (see [API Reference](/api-reference)).

### Output Guarantees

- **Consistent format**: Response format is guaranteed to be consistent
- **No data leakage**: Responses only contain detection results, never original text
- **Error handling**: Errors do not expose sensitive information

## Compliance Disclaimers

### No Certifications

OpenRedaction is **not certified** under:
- ISO 27001
- SOC 2
- HIPAA (as a Business Associate)
- PCI DSS

**Important**: If you require certified services, you should:
- Self-host OpenRedaction on certified infrastructure
- Use OpenRedaction as part of a certified system
- Consult with your compliance team

### Best-Effort Redaction

**User Responsibility**: You are responsible for verifying redacted output.

- OpenRedaction provides **best-effort** PII detection and redaction
- No guarantee of 100% detection accuracy
- False positives and false negatives are possible
- Manual review is recommended for highly sensitive data

**Recommendations**:
- Test with known PII patterns before production use
- Implement manual review processes for critical data
- Use multiple detection methods for high-risk scenarios
- Regularly audit redaction effectiveness

### Legal Disclaimer

OpenRedaction is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We are not responsible for:
- Data breaches or security incidents
- Compliance violations
- Incorrect redaction results
- Any damages arising from use of the service

**You are responsible for**:
- Ensuring compliance with applicable regulations
- Verifying redaction accuracy
- Implementing appropriate security controls
- Protecting your API keys and credentials

## Self-Hosting for Enhanced Security

For organizations with strict security or compliance requirements, self-hosting provides:

- **Complete control**: Full control over data flow and processing
- **Data residency**: Process data in your own region or infrastructure
- **No external dependencies**: No data leaves your environment
- **Customization**: Modify detection patterns and behavior as needed
- **Audit trails**: Implement your own logging and monitoring

See the [Self Hosting](/self-hosting) guide for deployment instructions.

## Security Best Practices

### For API Users

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for API requests
2. **Secure API keys**: Store keys securely, never in code or logs
3. **Validate inputs**: Validate text before sending to API
4. **Handle errors**: Implement proper error handling
5. **Monitor usage**: Track API usage for anomalies
6. **Rotate keys**: Regularly rotate API keys

### For Library Users

1. **Keep updated**: Regularly update the library for security patches
2. **Review code**: Review library code if self-hosting
3. **Secure configuration**: Protect configuration files and secrets
4. **Monitor performance**: Monitor for performance issues or anomalies
5. **Test thoroughly**: Test with known PII patterns

## Reporting Security Issues
