## Versioning Policy

OpenRedaction follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### API Versioning

The hosted API uses path-based versioning:
- Current version: `v1` (e.g., `/v1/ai-detect`)
- Future versions: `v2`, `v3`, etc.

**Backward Compatibility**:
- We maintain backward compatibility within a major version
- Breaking changes require a new major version
- Deprecated versions receive at least 6 months notice

**Deprecation Policy**:
- Deprecated versions are announced at least 6 months in advance
- Deprecated versions remain available during the notice period
- Migration guides are provided for major version upgrades

## Migration Guides

### From v0.x to v1.0.0

If you were using a pre-release version:

1. **API Endpoints**: Update endpoints to include version prefix (`/v1/ai-detect`)
2. **Error Handling**: Error response format is now standardized (see [API Reference](/api-reference))
3. **Response Headers**: Usage tracking headers are now included in all responses

### Library Updates

No breaking changes in the npm library API. All existing code should continue to work.
